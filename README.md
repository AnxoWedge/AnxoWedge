## Who am i? 
<hr>
My name's Ângelo, and I am a software engineer and entrying Data science and ML. Aside from slapping keys everyday, you can also find me in the following projects:

- Co-founder in [Creative Discovery](https://creativediscovery.pt), a Digital Marketing Agency
- Tinkering with AIs
- Neurology + programming 
- Drone filming

It's my daily strive to solve problems and try new ideas and technologies that keep me going far and beyond. So it was natural to me to choose a career path that allows me to solve mine and other peoples' problems through engineering and coding solutions that are creative and useful in our daily lives. I’m always looking for new challenges, and I am not afraid of engaging in new environments just for that. Hit me up if you have any interesting project we can work together. :)
